I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at the **National University of Singapore**, supervised by Prof. [Yang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MtBs-kMAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Zhiyuan Liu](https://acharkq.github.io/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of AI and the life sciences, with a particular focus on **AI for Proteins** (including protein evolution, design, and structure prediction) and **AI for Drug Discovery** (especially structure-based drug design).

I have been fortunate to gain research experience at several leading institutions. At the  **University of Florida** , I worked with  Prof. [Yanjun Li](https://yanjun-li.com/) ; at  **Rice University** , I was mentored by  Prof. [Han Xiao](https://xiao.rice.edu/People/hanxiao/hanxiao.html) ; and at  **Caltech** , I collaborated with Dr. [Sijie Ji](https://sijieji.github.io/) . Before I came to NUS, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Engineering from the  **Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications**.
